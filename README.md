How to Build Executable System Specifications Tutorial Series

I am starting a new series of lessons in how to build executable specifications of software intensive systems.

The underlying methodology is Shlaer-Mellor Executable UML.

Just breaking ground on the project now, but hope to have the first tutorial ready in the coming weeks.

Each tutorial will be packaged as a short and compelling video to be posted on the Model Integration YouTube channel.
